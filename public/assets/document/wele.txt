Product Requirements Document 
Version: 1.0 
 
Executive Summary 
WE-LE is building a Learning Universe centered on Personalized Learning. 
WE-LE is a personalized learning and career transformation platform designed to help 
students, working professionals, and career switchers learn job-ready skills through courses, 
AI tools, mentor guidance, real-world simulations, and portfolio creation. 
Unlike traditional e-learning platforms that give the same content to everyone, WE-LE uses 
AI to personalize learning paths, recommend the right lesx`x`sons, and prepare learners for 
interviews with mock interviews and SkillVerse simulations. 
Our Learning Universe concept means: Every learner enters their own personalized 
galaxy of content, mentors, communities, and opportunities tailored specifically to their 
goals, strengths, and career aspirations. No two learning journeys are the same. 
This PRD aims to deeply describe the complete product scope, including learning modules, 
AI systems, workflows, user experience, and business outcomes that power this 
personalized learning universe. 
The platform creates a continuous improvement cycle: understand the learner → 
personalize their journey → teach them → test their knowledge → help them practice 
→ showcase their skills → connect them with mentors and employers.

3. Core Features 
Each feature below is described in simple terms: what it does, why it matters, how it works, 
and what "done" looks like. 
3.1 Career Compass — Understanding Each Learner From Day One 
What it is: 
 Career Compass is the entry point to your personalized Learning Universe. It's a smart 
assessment that figures out what kind of career path suits each learner best. It's the first 
thing learners see when they sign up. 
How it works: 
 When someone joins WE-LE, they take a 30-question assessment. The questions adapt 
based on their answers — if they show interest in coding, they get more coding questions; if 
they lean toward design, they get design questions. 
The quiz covers all our learning tracks: 
● Development (coding/programming) 
● Design (UI/UX) 
● DevOps/Cloud (infrastructure) 
● AI/ML (artificial intelligence) 
● Product Management 
● Operations 
● Marketing 
The first 10 questions are easy and broad to understand general interests. The next 10 
questions dive deeper into the top 2 areas where they showed strength. The final 10 
questions are practical scenarios that test how they think and solve problems. 
What the learner gets: 
 After completing Career Compass, learners see: 
 
● A dashboard showing which career tracks suit them best (with visual bars showing 
strength in each area) 
● 3 job roles they could aim for (either now or after some learning) 
● A clear list of 3–6 things they need to improve (like "learn React" or "practice 
problem-solving") 
● A recommended learning path with an 8–12 week timeline 
● A button to start their personalized journey right away 
Why this matters for business: 
 Career Compass is how we create each learner's personalized universe. It helps us 
understand each person deeply from day one, so we can recommend the right courses, 
mentors, and content — which keeps people engaged and more likely to pay for premium 
features. 
What "done" looks like: 
● The quiz runs smoothly from start to finish 
● Results are saved to the learner's profile 
● The system shows accurate career track matches 
● At least 3 job roles are recommended 
● A learning pathway is generated with milestones 
● The learner can start their recommended path with one click 
3.2 Level Up AI — Your Personal Learning Coach in the Universe 
What it is: 
 Level Up AI is your personal guide through the WE-LE Learning Universe. It's an AI 
assistant that acts like a personal tutor, always available to answer questions, suggest what 
to learn next, and keep learners on track. 
How it works: 
 Unlike a regular chatbot, Level Up AI knows everything about the learner — their Career 
Compass results, quiz scores, mock interview performance, and course progress. When 
someone asks "How do I get better at debugging?" Level Up AI doesn't give a generic 
answer. Instead, it says: 
*"Based on your profile, try these 3 things: 
1. Complete the 8-minute Debugging Basics micro-lesson 
2. Practice in the Debug Challenge SkillVerse scenario (20 minutes) 
3. Book a 30-minute session with Mentor Sarah who specializes in debugging 
What makes it Unique: 
● Understands what the learner already knows 
● Only recommends content they have access to (or clearly shows paid add-ons) 
● Explains why each recommendation fits their goals 
● Shows progress summaries when asked ("How am I doing?") 
● Sends optional reminders about upcoming sessions or pending tasks
 
Why this matters for business: 
 Level Up AI is the navigation system in our Learning Universe. It keeps learners engaged by 
making learning feel personal and actionable. It also drives revenue by smartly suggesting 
mentor sessions and additional courses when appropriate. 
What "done" looks like: 
● The AI responds with helpful recommendations 90% of the time 
● Every recommendation links to actual content (courses, mentors, practice scenarios) 
● At least 20% of suggestions lead to action (learner clicks and starts) 
● The AI explains why it's making each suggestion 
● Learners can turn notifications on or off 
What we need: 
● Access to Career Compass results 
● Real-time tracking of learner progress 
● Course and mentor availability data 
● Safety controls to prevent inappropriate responses 
● Conversation logs for improvement 
3.3 AI Mock Interview — Practice Before the Real Thing 
What it is: 
 AI Mock Interview lets learners practice job interviews with an AI interviewer. It feels like a 
real interview and gives detailed feedback afterward. This is part of the skills validation layer 
in our Learning Universe. 
How it works: 
 Learners can book a mock interview session. The AI creates questions based on: 
● The course they're taking 
● Their Career Compass results 
● Their resume and portfolio 
● The job role they're targeting 
The mock interview has two parts: 
Part 1 — The Interview: 
 The learner answers questions (they can type or speak). The AI asks follow-up questions 
based on their answers, just like a real interviewer would. 
Part 2 — The Feedback: 
 After the interview, the system provides: 
● An overall score 
● Sub-scores for communication, problem-solving, and technical knowledge 
● A transcript of the conversation 
● 5 specific things to improve
 
● Recommended micro-lessons and practice scenarios 
● Suggestion to book a mentor for deeper coaching 
Why this matters for business: 
 Interview practice is incredibly valuable — it directly improves job placement rates. This is a 
premium feature people will pay for, and it builds confidence that WE-LE actually prepares 
people for real jobs. 
Pricing approach: 
● Include 2 mock interviews with premium course packages 
● Offer individual sessions for purchase 
● Consider giving one free trial to show value 
What "done" looks like: 
● The mock interview runs without technical issues 
● Transcription is at least 90% accurate 
● Feedback report is ready within minutes 
● Learners can replay their interview recording 
● The scoring reasonably matches what a human would score (we'll test this with real 
mentors) 
Success metrics: 
● How many learners retake mocks after getting feedback 
● Whether scores improve on the second attempt 
● How many mock interview takers book mentor sessions afterward 
What we need: 
● Question bank organized by job role and skill level 
● Speech-to-text technology 
● Scoring system (with human review initially) 
● Video/audio recording infrastructure 
● Privacy controls (learners can delete recordings) 
 
3.4 Session Wrap-up Quiz — Learning by Testing 
What it is: 
 After every class or video session, learners get a short quiz (4–8 questions) to test what 
they just learned. This creates a continuous feedback loop in the Learning Universe. 
How it works: 
 The system automatically creates quiz questions based on what was covered in the 
session. Questions test understanding and practical application, not just memorization. 
When learners submit answers:
 
● They get instant feedback with explanations 
● Their results are saved to their profile 
● If they score below 60%, the system marks that topic as "needs work" 
● Level Up AI automatically suggests extra practice 
For instructors and admins, there's a dashboard showing: 
● How the whole class performed 
● Which concepts most people struggled with 
● Which learners might need extra help 
Why this matters for business: 
 Frequent testing helps people remember more (proven learning science). It also gives us 
data to improve courses and personalize recommendations. When we can show "95% of our 
students master this concept," it's powerful marketing. 
What "done" looks like: 
● Quizzes appear within 15 minutes after each session 
● Questions match what was taught (80% relevance or higher) 
● Low-scoring learners automatically get practice suggestions 
● Trainers can see class performance summaries 
What we need: 
● Question bank tagged by topic and difficulty 
● Way to map each session to relevant questions 
● Storage for quiz results by skill area 
● Dashboard for trainers 
3.5 Personalized Mentorship — Human Guidance  
What it is: 
 In the WE-LE Learning Universe, every learner gets access to experienced guides — 
mentors who provide one-on-one guidance. It's a marketplace where learners can find the 
right mentor for their unique journey. 
How it works: 
 Each mentor has a profile showing: 
● Their area of expertise 
● Verified credentials and badges 
● Hourly rate 
● Available time slots 
● Ratings from previous learners 
The system recommends mentors based on: 
● The learner's Career Compass results 
● Areas where they need help (from quizzes and mock interviews) 
 
● Mentor's specialization 
● Ratings and reviews 
Types of mentorship: 
● Career coaching: Planning career moves, resume reviews 
● Technical coaching: Code reviews, debugging help, architecture guidance 
● Portfolio coaching: Improving project presentations 
● Interview prep: Practice and strategy 
Booking and payment: 
● Some courses include mentor credits (e.g., 2 sessions included) 
● Learners can buy individual sessions 
● Subscription option for ongoing mentorship 
After each session: 
● Mentors write brief notes on what was covered 
● They can endorse specific skills on the learner's profile 
● Learners rate the session 
● Notes appear in the learner's profile and inform Level Up AI recommendations 
Why this matters for business: 
 Mentorship is a major revenue source and keeps people engaged. It also creates trust — 
having real experts validate your skills is powerful for getting hired. 
Quality control: 
● Mentors go through a vetting process 
● We track performance (ratings, learner outcomes) 
● Low-performing mentors are put on probation or removed 
What "done" looks like: 
● Learners can search and book mentors 
● Booking confirmation and calendar invite work 
● Mentor notes are saved and visible 
● Payment processing works smoothly 
● Ratings are collected after sessions 
Success metrics: 
● How many mentors have regular bookings 
● Average rating (target: 4.5 out of 5) 
● How many learners book mentors again 
● Revenue from mentorship 
What we need:
 
● Mentor profiles and verification system 
● Calendar and booking system 
● Payment processing with mentor payouts 
● Rating and review system 
● Way to handle disputes or cancellations 
3.6 Skills Showcase — Your Living Portfolio 
What it is: 
 Skills Showcase is your personal proof-of-learning in the WE-LE Universe. It's an online 
portfolio that grows as learners complete projects, courses, and challenges. It's proof of what 
they can do. 
How it works: 
 Every time a learner completes something meaningful (a project, a SkillVerse challenge, a 
course), they can add it to their Skills Showcase. Each portfolio item includes: 
● What the problem was: Context and challenge 
● What they built: Link to demo, code, or artifact 
● Technologies used: Tools and skills applied 
● Skill tags: Which skills this demonstrates (and proficiency level) 
● AI summary: Auto-generated description 
● Verification badge: Optional mentor or peer review 
● Outcome notes: Like "won hackathon" or "deployed to 100 users" 
Portfolio building workflow: 
1. Learner completes a project 
2. System suggests a portfolio template 
3. Learner fills in details 
4. Optional: Request mentor verification 
5. Mentor reviews and adds verification badge 
6. Learner publishes or keeps private 
Skill proficiency calculation: 
 The system combines multiple signals to show skill level: 
● Quiz scores in that skill 
● Mock interview performance 
● Mentor ratings 
● Project complexity 
Sharing: 
 Learners get a public link they can share with employers. They control what's visible — can 
keep some items private or anonymous. 
Why this matters for business: 
 A strong portfolio is what gets people hired. When employers see verified, real work, they
 
trust it. Over time, we can connect high-performing portfolios with employer partners looking 
to hire. 
What "done" looks like: 
● Learners can create and edit portfolio items 
● Verification request workflow works (learner asks → mentor reviews → badge added) 
● Public share links work and look professional 
● Privacy controls let learners choose visibility 
Success metrics: 
● How many learners publish portfolios 
● Percentage of items that get verified 
● How many employer views each portfolio gets 
● Interview calls that come from portfolio shares 
What we need: 
● Portfolio templates by project type 
● Verification workflow 
● Public page design (mobile-friendly) 
● Privacy settings 
● Analytics on portfolio views 
3.7 Course Community — Learning Together in the Universe 
What it is: 
 Each course in the WE-LE Learning Universe has its own community space where current 
students and alumni can connect, share, help each other, and find opportunities. Think of it 
as your course's home base in the universe. 
How it works: 
 When someone enrolls in a course, they automatically join that course's community. Unlike 
typical forums that die after the course ends, WE-LE communities are ongoing — new 
batches join the same community, so it grows over time. 
What's in a community: 
● Announcements: Important updates from instructors 
● Discussion threads: Questions, tips, resources 
● Resource library: Shared notes, tools, references 
● Job board: Opportunities shared by alumni or employers 
● Alumni highlights: Success stories and career updates 
● Events: Community webinars and mentor Q&A sessions 
Different roles: 
● Learners: Can post, comment, share resources 
● Alumni: Same as learners, plus can post job opportunities
 
● Mentors: Can host Q&A sessions 
● Admins: Can pin posts, moderate, organize events 
Why this matters for business: 
 Communities keep people engaged after courses end. They create word-of-mouth 
marketing when alumni share success stories. They also become a talent pool for employers 
looking to hire from WE-LE. 
What "done" looks like: 
● New community created automatically for each course 
● Auto-join works when someone enrolls 
● Posting, commenting, and threading work smoothly 
● Moderation tools available for admins 
● Resources can be pinned for easy access 
Success metrics: 
● How many people post or comment per week 
● How many learners are referred by community members 
● How engaged people stay after course ends 
What we need: 
● Community platform (forums or chat-style) 
● Moderation tools 
● Different permission levels 
● Search functionality 
● Integration with courses 
3.8 Webinars — Live Learning Events in the Universe 
What it is: 
 Webinars are live online events on specific topics — like constellation events in our 
Learning Universe. They serve multiple purposes: attracting new learners, educating current 
students, and connecting with employers. 
Types of webinars: 
1. Free/Public Webinars (Lead Generation):

Where webinars appear: 
● Course pages (related webinars) 
● Community feeds 
● Marketing emails 
● Landing pages 
Why this matters for business: 
 Webinars bring in new learners (free events), add value to paid courses (premium content), 
and generate revenue through sponsorships. They also help learners understand what 
companies want, improving job placement. 
What "done" looks like: 
● Webinars can be scheduled and promoted 
● Registration system works 
● Live session runs smoothly (video, audio, chat) 
● Recording is available afterward 
● Attendance is tracked 
Success metrics: 
● How many webinar attendees sign up for courses 
● Attendee satisfaction (post-event survey) 
● Sponsor return on investment (leads generated) 
What we need: 
● Webinar hosting platform 
● Registration system 
● Recording and storage 
● Integration with course recommendations 
● Analytics on conversion 
 
4. How Everything Works Together in the Learning 
Universe 
The Golden Rule: Everything connects to a single learner profile — your personal ID in the 
Learning Universe. 
All features write to and read from one central place: 
● Career Compass results 
● Quiz scores 
● Mock interview reports 
● Mentor session notes 
● Portfolio items 
● Community activity 
● Course progress 
This means: 
● Level Up AI can give smart recommendations 
● Mentors see the full picture 
● Reporting shows complete learner journey 
● Employers can see verified capabilities 
Access and Entitlements: 
 The system needs to know what each learner has access to in their personalized universe: 
● Which courses they've purchased 
● How many mock interviews are included 
● Mentor session credits remaining 
● Premium vs free features 
Transparency: 
 Whenever the system makes a recommendation or decision, it shows why: 
● "We recommend this because your Career Compass showed interest in frontend 
development and your last quiz indicated you need practice with React." 
Privacy and Control: 
● Learners must agree before video/audio recording 
● They control what's public in their portfolio 
● They can view, download, or delete their data 
● Clear roles control who sees what (learner, mentor, admin, employer) 
Quality Control: 
 For critical AI features (Career Compass scoring, mock interview feedback), we start with 
human review to ensure quality before fully automating. 
What's Free vs Paid:
 
● Free: Career Compass, basic Level Up AI, portfolio creation, course communities 
● Included in course purchase: Some mock interviews and mentor credits 
● Paid add-ons: Extra mock interviews, additional mentor sessions, premium Level Up 
AI features 
● Revenue opportunities: Mentorship marketplace, webinar sponsorships, employer 
partnerships
